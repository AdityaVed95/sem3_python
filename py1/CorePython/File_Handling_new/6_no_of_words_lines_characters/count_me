Since its inception, JSON has quickly become the de facto standard
for information exchange. Chances are you’re here because you need
to transport some data from here to there. Perhaps you’re gathering information through an API or storing your data in a document database. One way or another, you’re up to your neck in JSON, and you’ve got to Python your way out.
Luckily, this is a pretty common task, and—as with most common tasks—Python makes it
almost disgustingly easy. Have no fear, fellow Pythoneers and Pythonistas. This one’s gonna be a breeze!
